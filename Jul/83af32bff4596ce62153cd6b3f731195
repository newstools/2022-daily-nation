What you need to know:  An analysis of the test done yesterday indicated that after one hour, results from 50 polling stations had been transmitted.This means that if the same speed is used on the actual voting day, then it will take 100 hours to transmit results from all polling stations, meaning that Kenyans will know the final results after four days.
