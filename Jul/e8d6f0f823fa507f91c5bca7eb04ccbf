What you need to know:  Morocco has distinct advantage in the production of phosphorus fertilisers. It possesses over 70 per cent of the world’s phosphate rock reserves, from which the phosphorus used in fertilisers is derived.And this makes Morocco a gatekeeper of global food supply chains because all food crops require the element phosphorus to grow. Indeed, so does all plant life. Unlike other finite resources, such as fossil fuels, there is no alternative to phosphorus.In 2021, the global phosphorus fertiliser market amounted to about USD59 billion. In Morocco, the sector’s 2020 revenues amounted to USD5.94 billion.
