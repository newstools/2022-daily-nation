What you need to know:  In the second term, the president has lived up to his sidekicks’ ominous hints that Kenyans would encounter a more autocratic Kenyatta after the 2017 election.Indeed, consecutive executive orders abundantly evinced this resolve, as the President reconfigured his executive to align the state with his will, and annexe government as an appendage of his person.It is, therefore, no accident that the legacy term has been characterised by violence, arrests, curfews, extra-judicial killings, demolitions, evictions and other demonstrations of violent official impunity.
