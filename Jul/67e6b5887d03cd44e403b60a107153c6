What you need to know:  It goes without saying that the two-time Olympics champion in 1,500m Faith Chepng’etich was a woman under pressure to soothe the Kenyans' souls right after the steeplechase disappointment.“I was facing a lot of pressure. Everybody was expecting something special from me. Everybody was like, Faith, we believe in Faith, so it was a real pressure. But I managed it,” said Chepng’etich, who only needed to win the race and arguably become the Greatest of all time (G.O.A.T) in the race.
