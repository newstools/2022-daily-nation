What you need to know:  State capture is not just mere corruption; it is the use of government for personal gain, aggrandisement and making the whole structure work for individuals and private companies.Deputy President and Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has described the difference between state capture and corruption thus: “Corruption is stealing milk, while state capture is stealing the cow and selling us the milk.”In Kenya, the issue that should concern citizens is whether any individuals in government or out of it have captured any state institutions and sectors of the economy, and the damage this has wrought to the country.
