What you need to know:  Yego is hoping to make the final on his fifth appearance at the world event but reckons that competition will be stiff with nine throwers registering over 87m efforts this year.“Anything can happen in the final but it’s my dream to win the world title again. I know what it takes since it will need that big single throw and the rest will take care of itself,” said Yego, who has a season best of 80.62m from the Kenyan trials on June 25.
