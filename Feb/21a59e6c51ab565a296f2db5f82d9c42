What you need to know:  As usual, sports can never be complete without fans. Now that the government has okayed the return of fans to stadia, I expect to see capacity crowds at each of the venues. However, remember we are not out of the woods yet as far as Covid-19 is concerned.As your cheer on the athletes, always adhere to the safety regulations laid down by the Ministry of Health, for the sake of your fellow supporter, family, and friends as well as yourself.
