What you need to know:  While telecommunication giants Safaricom have agreed to sponsor the trials at a tune of Sh500, 000, Kirui said the amount is not enough. “Deaflympics trials is a big event…It needs a lot of logistics in terms of ambulances, payment of stadium, field and track referees, Covid-19 marshals and other essentials,” said Kirui. “We appeal to other sponsors and well-wishers to supplement Safaricom's support to make the event colourful and successful.”
