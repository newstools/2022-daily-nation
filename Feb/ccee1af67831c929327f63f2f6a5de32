What you need to know:  During Monday’s second round at the par 72 Karen Country Club course, Mapwanya collected 10 pars and eight birdies, four in each half in the bogey-free round.“I real enjoyed playing on this course, though I must say my game was well balanced today where I made 23 putts. Putting and approach shots were however my strength," said Mapwanya.
