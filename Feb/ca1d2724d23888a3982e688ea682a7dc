What you need to know:  A confident KPA coach Antony Ojukwu said that the away win was inevitable and hailed his charges for their sublime display especially in defence.“We could be favourites to win the title but overconfidence can ruin the party,”said Ojukwu, explaining that they launched the title chase poorly on Saturday, but was glad his charges rose to the occasion to tie the Series.“I am a defensive coach and I’m glad the team embraced that tact. I hope we finish what we started and reclaim the title,” said Ojukwu.
