What you need to know:  At Mbaraki, goals from David Majak and Erick Zakayo in either half were enough to sink Bandari and pile more pressure on Rwandese coach Casa Mbung’o. At Nyayo Stadium, Robert Mudenyu's 13th minute goal gave Ingwe the lead, but Bidco’s John Nairuka equalised 12 minutes later to see both sides share spoils.
