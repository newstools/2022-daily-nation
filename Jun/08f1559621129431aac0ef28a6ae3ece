What you need to know:  What perturbs us is that the purported workers of the sports ministry are still paid their salaries and are very pleased about it. They are now moving even slower than the tortoises.For these stadia to function properly and be worth the expenditure, we suggest that Sports Ministry and stadia staff's salaries only be paid from stadia revenue.This way, we shall see some semblance of speed in this sector.
