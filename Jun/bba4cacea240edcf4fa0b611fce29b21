What you need to know:  The first Finn to win the Safari Rally was Hannu Mikkola in 1972 in the famous Ford Escort RS1600. Mikkola again won the Safari in 1987 in an Audi 200 Quattro. He was one of my favourite drivers in my childhood years.The next flying Finn to win in Kenya was Ari Vatanen, who conquered the toughest motorcar race in the world in 1983 in an Opel Ascona 400.
