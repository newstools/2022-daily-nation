What you need to know:  The Cranes are aware that the last two times they qualified (Gabon 2017 and Egypt 2019), they had to pick six points away from home.So expectations are clear although little magic is expected as Uganda come up against Group F favourites, 2019 African champions and Arab Cup reigning kings, Algeria.
