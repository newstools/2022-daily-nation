What you need to know:  Ng'eno was pleased with second place, despite the race not been his specialty. "Coming in second in 10,000m has impressed me because that's not my specialty. I normally compete in 5,000m race which goes down tomorrow and this was just part of my training ahead of the main event," said Ng'eno, who is pursuing a Bachelors of Education degree.
