What you need to know:  Should a league be won or lost on boardroom points? Should the decision of a non-contending club determine who wins the title?These questions are of great concern to us. They are downright unfair and any team that shall celebrate winning a league in this manner is a useless and shameless outfit. Justice must be done!
