What you need to know:  Kenya Volleyball Federation deputy chairman Charles Nyaberi said they have full confidence in the playing unit and the technical bench.“Only two pairs will make the cut in both genders. We really don’t know the countries that will be participating in the qualifiers, but hopefully by the weekend we will have the information. We are putting the final touches and teams are likely to leave for the host nation on March 20,” said Nyaberi.
