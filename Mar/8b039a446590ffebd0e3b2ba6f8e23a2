What you need to know:  We should start looking at the next crop of athletes to emerge in Paris and then again in 2028 in Los Angeles.We need ask ourselves, where is Malkia Strikers squad to Los Angeles 2028 Games, or Rugby Sevens team to Brisbane 2032?How will they not only qualify but win medals? If the youth teams are not known today, we may qualify but we can forget winning any medals.
