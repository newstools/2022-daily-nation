What you need to know:  As Rev Akaranga proved when he started Vihiga Queens, a little cash inflow in our youth can have serious returns on investment. If Akaranga could do it and most likely with less cash from Treasury than some of the counties, you too can surely do something for your youth.We need to see more Shilwatsos and more Shikangwas shining at the county, country and international levels. I have been involved in women football management and I can say for a fact that when one girl makes it to top-flight in any sport, the multiplier effect on the young girls who look up to such achievers is simply astounding.
