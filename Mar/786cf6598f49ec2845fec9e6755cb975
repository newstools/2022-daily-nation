What you need to know:  This document tells us that: Nearly half of the budget was allocated to administrative costs (Sh 405m); nearly 30% was allocated for FKF Caretaker Committee and secretariat compensation (Sh261m); Sh65m was allocated for “stakeholder engagement” but few have been held; Sh100m was allocated for FKF elections yet the last elections cost around Sh10m; Sh170m was allocated for grants to clubs.The 18 Kenyan Premier League clubs have only received Sh600,000 each for  four months.  If that leaked budget is fake, then where is the real one? How has been cash been allocated and spent?
