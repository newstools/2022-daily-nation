What you need to know:  My wild cards, with an outside chance of victory are Zimbabwe’s Robinson Chinhoi – he has continued to dominate the Safari Tour and has the skills to really play well.Kenya’s coast-based golfers Daniel Nduva and Adel Balala could very easily write a fairy tale at Muthaiga – they are very long off the tee, they have youth on their side and I have no doubt they will have the full support of the Kenyan fans.
