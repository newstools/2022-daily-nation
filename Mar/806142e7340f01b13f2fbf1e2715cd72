What you need to know:  Gor Mahia’s case at the SDT challenging the Caretaker Committee’s punishment comes up for hearing today.I will be keen to hear K’Ogalo’s defence, if there is any. I sign off with one last question.Are we waiting for lives to be lost in the stadium to decisively confront violence in our football stadiums?
