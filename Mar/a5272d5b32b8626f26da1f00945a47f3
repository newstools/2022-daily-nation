What you need to know:  Kipruto won bronze during the 2019 World Championships with Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei bagging gold ahead of Ethiopia’s Yomif Kejecha.“This year I want to concentrate and participate in few races because I want to get a slot in the World Championships team and since we have few months, I need to be in good shape because Kenyan trials are competitive and I don’t want to miss out like last year during the Olympic Games trials,” Kipruto told Nation Sport.
