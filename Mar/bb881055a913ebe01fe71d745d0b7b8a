What you need to know:  One thing we are taught in sports is to respect the decision of the referees who carry out the difficult role of officiating matches week in, week out.They are the designated arbiter on the field of battle, literally. Without them, there would be no fair contest.Thank you Kenya rugby fraternity for speaking with one voice against violent conduct on our field of play, especially that perpetrated by a player(s).I look forward to KRU sending out a strong message over this matter.
