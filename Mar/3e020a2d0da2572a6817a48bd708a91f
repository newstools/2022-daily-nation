What you need to know:  The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on Thursday rejected Zuma's bid to have the state prosecutor in his long-delayed trial removed, and did so with costs.Zuma had argued that the prosecutor had lost 'title' to act in his matter due to alleged bias.But the SCA, as with the High Court before it, found there to be no merit in the argument, and said that there was "no prospect for success" should Zuma attempt a further appeal.
