What you need to know:  Last month a newly emerged organisation, Operation Dudula, was involved in confrontations with foreign business owners in Johannesburg.Operational Dudula leaders insist they are not xenophobic, but are merely trying to "rid the country of undocumented foreigners" who, the grassroots movement supporters believe, are "taking jobs from South Africans".During the confrontations in Alexandra on Monday, foreign business owners attempting to resume trading near Alexandra's famous Pan Africa Mall faced down aggressive Operation Dudula activists.
