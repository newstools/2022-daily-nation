What you need to know:

Real Madrid sit 17 points clear of Barcelona in La Liga. They are on course to win the title while Barca would sign now for the top four. Karim Benzema and Vinicius Junior have scored only two fewer goals in the league than the entire Barca squad. In Europe, the two clubs are no longer even playing in the same competition.The gap has widened, not because of Madrid's improvement this season under Ancelotti - although that has helped - but because of Barcelona's plunge into mediocrity.
