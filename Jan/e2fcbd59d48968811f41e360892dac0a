Coach Abate blamed the opening group match defeat partly on the fact that they were under pressure playing 10 against 11.“When you lose one player early like was the case with the game against Cape Verde, it affects the game,” the coach said.The match will be played at the 60,000-seater Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé from 7pm (Kenyan time) and will be the first of two matches for the day as Cape Verde will face Burkina Faso in a second group fixture.
