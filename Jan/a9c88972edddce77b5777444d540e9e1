Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed warned rogue coaches and agents who want to ruin the sport by fleecing athletes of their hard earned cash or introducing them to drugs.“It is really sad we are mourning the champion today who was to compete in the race because of rogue people surrounding her career.
