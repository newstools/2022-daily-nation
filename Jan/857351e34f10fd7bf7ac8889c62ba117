What you need to know:

And we do not need to go far, let us pick ideas from Simba and turn around this club. Just a decade ago, Simba were in the same situation as we are now, but they refocused, repackaged and rebuilt the club. Today, Simba is the most organised club in East and Central Africa.I strongly believe that we can also do this at Gor Mahia,  Let’s do it. I hope that 2022 will go down in history as the year we turned our club around for posterity.
