What you need to know:

After winning two consecutive matches against Mathare United and Bidco United, Bernard Ondiek's 57th minute strike for Posta Rangers halted the winning momentum for the brewers. Bidco United also returned to winning ways with Jacob Onyango's sixth minute strike proving to be the difference in a match where KCB defender Robinson Kamura was red carded for a foul on David Gateri. The loss denied the bankers a chance to dislodge Homeboyz from the top.
