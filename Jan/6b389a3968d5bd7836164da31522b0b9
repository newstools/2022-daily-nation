Commenting on a Nigeria radio station from the Ghanaian capital on Wednesday, journalist Akosua Amoo said the mood in Accra is gloomy following the early elimination of the team form the tournament.“A team like Black Stars shouldn’t be losing to Comoros, we shouldn’t be struggling to make it out of the group stages. The Afcon is no longer 16 teams, it is 24 teams, so this is a bit pathetic,” she said.
