What you need to know:

Games have gotten tighter and I can say with confidence that even with the increased fixtures and presence of top predators – Mane, Salah, Wilfried Zaha, Sebastien Haller of Cote d’Ivoire, Samuel Chukwueze of Nigeria et al, on the prowl, Ndaye Mulamba’s stupendous record of nine goals scored for Zaire (now DR Congo) in a single tournament (1974) is safe.There is an ignominious record I pray gets broken soon. Kenya holds the record of the team with the highest appearance in the finals (six) that has never gone beyond the group stage.
