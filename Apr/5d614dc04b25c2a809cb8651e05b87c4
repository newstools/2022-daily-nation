What you need to know:  Justice Wendoh said there was no fault on the part of the Registrar by asking for a letter of no objection from the Registrar of Sports  to carry out the activities in the name of a Sports Club as he plans to eventually register himself with the Registrar of Sports."Although the petitioner had a right to register the proposed name as a private entity, he was also under duty to obtain a letter of no objection from the Registrar of Sports who is mandated to regulate sporting activities in the country," said the judge.
