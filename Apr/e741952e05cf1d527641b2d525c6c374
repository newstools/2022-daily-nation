What you need to know:  Lawyer Paul Muite has put Kakamega County and KCB Group on the spot for backing the lease awarded to Sarrai Group of Uganda.Mr Muite said it was unfortunate that the county government supported the deal, which was cancelled by the High Court last week and even sponsored a court case for the lease offered to Sarrai to be upheld.
