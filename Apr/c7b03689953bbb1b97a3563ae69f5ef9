What you need to know:  Hernan Crespo's Al Duhail lost 2-1 in the opening match against hosts Al Taawoun and then defeated Iranian side Sepahan 2-1 and Pakhtakor 3-2 since the campaign started over 10 days ago. Last year, Al Duhail narrowly missed out on a ticket for the knockout stage despite Olunga finishing as the top scorer with nine goals.
