What you need to know:  Although matching Margaret Court’s 24 Grand Slam singles titles from the 60s and early 70s has eluded the 40-year-old Serena, the American does not need validation, having already won 23 Grand Slam singles titles in a career spanning 26 years during which she revolutionised the women’s game with her powerful presence and strong serves.Clijsters and Serena are a shining example of women who have pushed the limits in a sport that sadly, still pays male players more than females. It is encouraging that gap is narrowing. Time to give equal pay for equal work.
