What you need to know:  In a long time, I have never seen middle aged men grinning from ear to ear like the fathers Jeremy, Rio, and McRae.Some observed that we have thrown the youngsters into the deep end too soon. Perhaps they were right because one of the biggest casualties of the rally was McRae who has a big responsibility of being the figure in his peer group.
