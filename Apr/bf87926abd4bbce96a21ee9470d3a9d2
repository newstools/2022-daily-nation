What you need to know:  For the San, arguably the First of all First Peoples, interactions with migrants, African or later European, have been almost uniformly disastrous.When Europeans, Dutch mainly at first, began arriving on the southern tip of Africa in the mid-1650s, the San had already been forced to the fringes of most of the best lands of southern Africa by fellow Africans who had arrived in preceding centuries from further north.Scorned by Bantu-speakers, the San were treated as "vermin" by white European settlers, who did not understand the San's view of nature and who resented their livestock being hunted or taken by San hunter-gatherers who did not use the idea of property and ownership in their culture.
