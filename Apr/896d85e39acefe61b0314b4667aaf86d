What you need to know:  I would certainly bid for any gloves on auction that Mohamoud Abbas, arguably, Kenya’s all-time best goalkeeper, wore. I wonder if he is in possession of any he used during his heady days with Harambee Stars and one of Kenya’s most successful clubs, AFC Leopards.Let me urge the current Kenyan sports stars to preserve for posterity the sportswear they wore or will wear when creating history.
