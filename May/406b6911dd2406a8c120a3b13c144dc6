What you need to know:  Be that as it may, those of us who still have the love of our beloved K’Ogalo will never miss any match whatever the prevailing circumstances. We have a cardinal duty to do so. And also in keeping the memories of the fans who went ahead of us alive.I am sure departed fans like Apingo Nyawawa, Odanga, Majimbo, Dick Danger and many others will be proud to know that we are still going to the stadium.
