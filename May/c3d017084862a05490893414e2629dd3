What you need to know:  Mathare United Chairman Bob Munro said they would have not faced the axe had the Caretaker Committee disbursed Sh900,000 before their match against Sofapaka on May 6, which they failed to honour to due to lack of funds."On May 10, four days before our scheduled match with Sofapaka and before its mandate ended,  the FKF Caretaker Committee finally paid its long overdue monthly grant arrears of Sh900,000," said Munro.
