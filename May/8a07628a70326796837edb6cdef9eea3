What you need to know:  Sixty-seven years later, the ground has changed little. Here is where the two historic Currie Cup Division One matches pitting Kenya Simbas versus Leopards on June 4 and versus Eastern Province Elephants on June 11 will be held.Excellent rugby fixtures that no true Kenyan rugby fan worth his salt will want to miss. Pity the disheveled, decrepit venue.
