What you need to know:  Yego, 33, is happy with his progress since finishing second at the Kip Keino Classic on May 7 where he threw a season’s best of 79.59 metres.“I lost a bit of my techniques and sharpness after a long layoff of close to two years. I am doing a lot of speed exercises, which is reactive,” said Yego’, adding that what he lacked at Kip Keino Classic was speed, having struggled on the runway. “It’s normal when you stay out for long.”
